The problem of Fault text (that contains fake news) has spread enormously in recent years. Social media is the major source for this type of news because it is easily and freely accessible to everyone and this type of news can be shared easily and rapidly, this enabled the widespread of news, so there is a need to detect this type of news. This news will mislead the users creating chaos and unrest. So the detection has become mandatory to avoid chaos and to maintain the pleasant news. We use Machine Learning Algorithms and basic Natural Language Process techniques to detect this type of news. In this work, Machine Learning Algorithms are used to parse the article and extract the summary from the article, this summary is used to predict the credibility. A passive-aggressive classifier and multinomial naive Bayes algorithms are used to train the model. A web app is created using the Flask API. One can put the URL in the web page to detect the news as "FAKE" or "REAL".
